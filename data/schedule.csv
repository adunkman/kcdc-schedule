You write User Stories. Now what? The next step is often to turn those User Stories into executable tests that can help you validate the proper behavior of your complex software systems. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is the engine that can help to drive this process on your project. The logical evolution of the often too fine-grained process of Test-Driven Development&comma; BDD not only represents a somewhat different technical practice but&comma; more importantly&comma; it also suggests an entirely different way of thinking about your system and the way in which you test it.10am,11am,Room 130,Peering Through the Clouds,Clint Edmonson,Heard of elastic computing? Cloud-bursting? Off-line rendering? Join us in this session where we walk through the key cloud scenarios every developer should be familiar with and when and where each should be used. We’ll discuss how the architecture of each of these scenarios is realized using the Windows Azure cloud platform.10am,11am,Room 135,Getting Started with SignalR,Kevin Griffin,SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for ASP.NET. It’s designed to help you build real-time web applications without a lot of hassle. In the past&comma; developers would have to wire up real-time applications as a series of polls to a webserver&comma; waiting for it to receive data back that was useful. This approach usually cost more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process&comma; and makes it more useful for the ASP.NET developer. In this presentation&comma; Kevin Griffin will guide you through implementing SignalR into your applications&comma; and how you can take advantage of everything it has to offer.10am,11am,Room 120,What's new in TFS 2011,John Alexander,No Description10am,11am,Room 215,(re)Introduction "Native" Programming,Michael Price,An overview of recent developments from the native programming world. Native programming has seen a resurgence over the past 5 years&comma; most notably with Objective-C at Apple and pretty soon C++/CX at Microsoft. But why?

Poor collaboration between developers and testers? Numerous post-production bugs? Regardless of your chosen methodology&comma; QA is always at the end of the lifecycle. The delays in every other part of the project cut into this all-important set of tasks. Improvements in the Microsoft test tools make it the premier tool for effectively AND efficiently testing your software project efforts whether they are huge&comma; waterfall projects or just a tiny bug fix.11:15am,12:15pm,Room 120,From the steps of the Ivory Tower,Adam Barney,Writing code in the real world is a never-ending set of tradeoffs&comma; most of which involve trading performace&comma; elegance&comma; maintainability&comma; etc… for decresed time to market. We could spend a lifetime perfecting a code base – writing code from our Ivory Tower. But that won’t get us far with our employers&comma; who need to get a product to the customer. In this session&comma; I’ll give you some tips on coding from the steps of the Ivory Tower. That is&comma; writing code that’s close to the impecable quality of Ivory Tower&comma; without spending a lifetime writing it.11:15am,12:15pm,Room 135,Akavach: An asynchronous key-value store for native apps,Paul Betts,Downloading and caching remote data while keeping the UI responsive is quickly becoming a task that nearly every desktop and mobile application needs to do. Akavache is a library that makes common app patterns easy (i.e. Load cached data from disk but fetch latest in background)&comma; as well as being fully asynchronous yet still easy to use. Akavache is also a great advanced demonstration of the power of the Reactive Extensions.<br/>In this talk I’ll give an overview of how to use Akavache in your applications&comma; and I will also go into the difficulties of writing a persistent key-value store&comma; and show how Rx simplifies complex race conditions. Prior knowledge of Rx will be helpful but I will assume developers to have no knowledge of Rx in this talk.11:15am,12:15pm,Room 130,Git More Done,Keith Dahlby,You’ve seen the intro&comma; you’ve cloned from GitHub&comma; maybe even committed once or twice…but you’re still not convinced Git’s learning curve is worth the climb. This session aims to shed some light from the real world on how Git is different&comma; why the differences matter&comma; and introduce some features and use cases you never knew you couldn’t live without. Topics covered will include rewriting history with interactive rebase&comma; separating concerns with patchwise add&comma; smashing bugs with bisect&comma; recovering from missteps with reflog and much more.11:15am,12:15pm,Room 215,Introduction to CoffeeScript,Nicholas Cloud,CoffeeScript has gained a reputation as the sane alternative to JavaScript. By leveraging the NodeJS platform&comma; CoffeeScript compiles down to JavaScript behind the scenes. Its syntax is terse; its expressiveness is powerful. The magic by which it sanitizes JavaScript has been known to make developers cry. This session will cover CoffeeScript basics&comma; the pros and cons of using CoffeeScript for development&comma; and an example implementation in an ASP.NET MVC project.11:15am,12:15pm,Room 235,Grid Display Tactics with MVC & jQuery,Gus Emery,The MVC Framework is setup to do single data editing out of the box&comma; but by utilizing the MVC framework and it’s supplied jQuery libraries this session will delve into the ability to create an editable data grid&comma; very similar to a desktop grid! To extend the basic MVC framework functionality we will be utilizing third party controls and frameworks; both JavaScript/jQuery and .Net. This session will incorporate jQuery&comma; CSS&comma; MVC and AJAX in its solution.12:15pm,1:15pm,Main Room,Lunch / Open Spaces,,,,,1:15pm,2:15pm,Room 125,Lessons Learned: Being Agile in a Waterfall World,Philip Japikse,Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the development community. But most non-development groups (such as Web Administrators&comma; Production Support&comma; Security&comma; Testing&comma; and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are not only far from agile&comma; that are not trying to move to be more agile. I start with a refresher on Scrum&comma; and then use real experiences from large enterprise development projects to teach you how to effectively work with non-agile teams. Instead of trying to convert them&comma; I discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while remaining agile in the development realm.1:15pm,2:15pm,Room 130,Building Secure Web Applications,Cory House,What could a hacker do to your web application? Lock all your users out of their account? Collect a list of every user’s email to spam them or lure them into a phishing scheme? Are your users passwords safe from theft? Could a simple brute force attack allow a hacker to login as another user? Is your application’s database at risk for total compromise? Are supposedly secure sections of your app actually easily accessible to the public? Are your admin users at risk of having their sessions stolen and impersonated? Let’s get clear answers to these critical concerns.<br/>This session leverages hacking techniques outlined in “The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook”. We will review a variety of best practices and potential pitfalls that are easy to overlook. We will discuss the top 10 most critical web app security issues and view their implications through real-time hacking of an insecure web application. And after we’ve seen how to hack&comma; we’ll discuss how to defend our apps from the thugs.1:15pm,2:15pm,Room 135,Android: Where You Can Stick Your Data,Jessica Kerr,Most useful applications require persistent storage. Most persistent storage requires a database. Android offers several local storage options: preferences&comma; files&comma; and a database.
